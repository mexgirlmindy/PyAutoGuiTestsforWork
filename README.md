# PyAutoGuiTestsforWork
A collection of pyautogui scripts that I use to test current company's software
PyAutoGui sends user like actions to the pc. Using PyAutoGui I can simulate a worker on their production software to pretend to do usual worker stuff like create a product label and then edit the label.
